# Video Games Sales Prediction



## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting video game sales using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data, we aim to develop a predictive model that estimates future sales based on key features such as platform, genre, publisher, and region-wise performance.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes attributes such as:

- `Rank` - Ranking of overall sales

- `Name` - The games name

- `Platform` - Platform of the games release ( PC,PS4)

- `Year` - Year of the game's release

- `Genre` - Genre of the game

- `Publisher` - Publisher of the game

- `NA_Sales` - Sales in North America (in millions)

- `EU_Sales` - Sales in Europe (in millions)

- `JP_Sales` - Sales in Japan (in millions)

- `Other_Sales` - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)

- `Global_Sales` - Total worldwide sales.

> There are 16,598 records. 2 records were dropped due to incomplete information.
